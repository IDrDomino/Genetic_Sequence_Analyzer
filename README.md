# Genetic Sequence Analyzer

The Genetic Sequence Analyzer is a simple web application that allows users to analyze a DNA sequence. Users can input a DNA sequence, and the application will provide information about the nucleotide count and the complementary DNA sequence.

## Project Files:

- index.html
The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
Provides an input field for entering a DNA sequence and a button to trigger the sequence analysis.
Displays the analysis results dynamically on the page.

- style.css
The CSS file that styles the HTML elements for a visually appealing layout.
Defines the styles for the header, input field, button, and result output.

- script.js
The JavaScript file that contains the logic for analyzing the DNA sequence.
Counts the occurrences of each nucleotide and displays the results.
Generates the complementary DNA sequence based on the input.
